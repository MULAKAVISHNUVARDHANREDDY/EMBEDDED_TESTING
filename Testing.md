# Embedded Testing
-------------------
1. What is Embedded Testing?
Embedded Testing is the process of validating and verifying the functionality, performance, timing, and safety of embedded hardware-software systems. These systems are often part of real-time environments such as:
- Automotive ECUs
- Medical devices
- Consumer electronics
- IoT and wearable devices

Embedded systems have strict constraints like timing, power usage, memory limitations, and interface precision, which makes testing a crucial and complex task.

2. Why is Embedded Testing Important?
        - Helps detect bugs early in development
        - Ensures hardware-software integration is reliable
        - Validates real-time behavior and timing requirements
        - Reduces the risk of field failures

3.What is Black Box Testing?

  - Black Box Testing is a testing technique where the internal structure, design, or implementation of the system is not known to the tester. It validates the system’s behavior solely based on input and output.
  In embedded systems, it is used to ensure that the system works as expected from the user or external interface perspective — without needing access to the source code or internal logic.
  
4.Why is Black Box Testing Important?

    - Does not require source code access
    - Tests the complete system functionality
    - Closely mimics real-world usage
    - Useful for validating final firmware, hardware integration, and system behavior
    - Essential for user acceptance and regulatory testing

# Embedded Testing
-------------------
What is Embedded Testing?
Embedded Testing is the process of validating and verifying the functionality, performance, timing, and safety of embedded hardware-software systems. These systems are often part of real-time environments such as:
- Automotive ECUs
- Medical devices
- Consumer electronics
- IoT and wearable devices
Embedded systems have strict constraints like timing, power usage, memory limitations, and interface precision, which makes testing a crucial and complex task.

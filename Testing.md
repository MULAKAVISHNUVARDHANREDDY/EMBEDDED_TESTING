# Embedded Testing
-------------------
1. What is Embedded Testing?
- Embedded Testing is the process of validating and verifying the functionality, performance, timing, and safety of embedded hardware-software systems. These systems are often part of real-time environments such as:

        - Automotive ECUs
        - Medical devices
        - Consumer electronics
        - IoT and wearable devices

- Embedded systems have strict constraints like timing, power usage, memory limitations, and interface precision, which makes testing a crucial and complex task.

2. Why is Embedded Testing Important?

       - Helps detect bugs early in development
       - Ensures hardware-software integration is reliable
       - Validates real-time behavior and timing requirements
       - Reduces the risk of field failures
# Black Box testing
---------------------
1.What is Black Box Testing?

  - Black Box Testing is a testing technique where the internal structure, design, or implementation of the system is not known to the tester. It validates the system‚Äôs behavior solely based on input and output.
  In embedded systems, it is used to ensure that the system works as expected from the user or external interface perspective ‚Äî without needing access to the source code or internal logic.
  
2.Why is Black Box Testing Important?

    - Does not require source code access
    - Tests the complete system functionality
    - Closely mimics real-world usage
    - Useful for validating final firmware, hardware integration, and system behavior
    - Essential for user acceptance and regulatory testing

    
| Use Case             | Description                                                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| System-level Testing | Verifies entire embedded system behavior (e.g., Button ‚Üí LED ON)         |
| Protocol Testing     | Sends and receives data via UART, SPI, I2C and checks for correct output |
| Acceptance Testing   | Ensures the product meets customer and functional requirements           |
| Firmware Validation  | Tests compiled firmware behavior without reviewing the source code       |


### 1Ô∏è‚É£ System-Level Testing

        1.Description:
                - This involves testing the entire embedded system as a whole
                   hardware, firmware, sensors, user interface, and communication ‚Äî from an external point of view.
         Example:
                - In a smart home device, pressing a physical button should activate a motor and turn on an indicator LED.
                - The tester verifies the result by pressing the button and checking the motor response and LED state without
                   knowing the internal logic or how the signal was processed.
        2.What is validated:
                - Complete signal flow from input (button) to output (motor/LED)
                - Hardware connections and debounce logic
                - Real-time responsiveness (e.g., output within 100ms.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Protocol Testing

        1.Description:
                - Used to verify that communication over serial protocols (UART, SPI, I2C, CAN, etc.)
                   works correctly and complies with the expected message structure and timing.
         Example:
                - Send a command like AT+TEMP? over UART to a microcontroller
                - Check if the response is OK:25.3 or ERROR
                - The tester monitors protocol lines and logs to evaluate behavior
        2.What is validated:
                - Correct command parsing
                - Valid response formatting
                - Timing requirements (e.g., response time < 50 ms)
                - CRC/error checking, framing, and retries.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Acceptance Testing

        1.Description:
                - Performed by the QA team or client to ensure that the final product meets business, functional, and user requirements.
                   This is the final validation before release.
         Example:
                - In a GPS tracking device, verify that the location is updated every 30 seconds in the mobile app.
                - Tester ensures end-to-end system (hardware ‚Üí firmware ‚Üí server ‚Üí app) works correctly
        2.What is validated:
                - All system features function as specified
                - Edge cases and real-world usage (e.g., cold start, lost GPS signal, battery depletion)
                - Interface compatibility (e.g., BLE with different phones)
                
### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Firmware Validation
                
          1. Description:
                - Validates the final compiled and flashed firmware (binary file), without reviewing or modifying the source code.
                  This confirms that the device behaves correctly with production firmware.
              Example:
                        - Flash a wearable device with final firmware
                        - Test user interactions: tapping the screen should open menus, notifications should vibrate the device

          2.What is validated:
                - Firmware stability and responsiveness
                - Bootloader functionality
                - Power-on self-tests and startup timing
                - Response to interrupts, button events, sensors.
# White Box testing
-------------------
- White Box Testing focuses on validating the internal logic, decision-making, and edge cases of your embedded code. 
It is done with access to the source code, typically using unit testing frameworks, debugging tools, and code coverage tools.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Unit Testing

1.Description:

   - Tests individual functions or modules in isolation to ensure they work as expected.
     This is the most granular level of testing.

```c
  Example:
      - You have a function that converts ADC sensor values to temperature:
        float adc_to_temp(uint16_t adc_value)
         {
            return (adc_value * 0.1f);
         }
```
  - Test case might check:
          - Does adc_to_temp(1000) return 100.0?
          - What happens when adc_value = 0?
    
2.What is validated:

   - Return values under normal and boundary inputs.
   - Proper use of arithmetic/logical expressions.
   - No side effects or unexpected changes to global state.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Code Path Testing
        1.Description:
                Verifies that all possible paths, branches, and conditional logic are executed
                at least once during testing.
```c                
 Example:
        int get_motor_state(bool enabled, int rpm)
        {
            if (!enabled) return 0;
            if (rpm > 1000) return 2;
            return 1;
        }
```
You need test cases that cover:

enabled = false ‚Üí returns 0

enabled = true, rpm = 1500 ‚Üí returns 2

enabled = true, rpm = 500 ‚Üí returns 1

‚úÖ What is validated:

All if/else conditions are exercised

Decision coverage (True/False paths for each boolean)

Code does not crash or behave unpredictably in any path

üõ† Tools used:

Unit testing frameworks

Coverage tools (gcov, lcov)

Static analysis tools (Cppcheck, SonarQube)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Boundary Testing
üîç Description:
Focuses on testing edge-case input values that might cause buffer overflows, underflows, or rounding errors.

üß™ Example:
For an array with size 10:

c
Copy
Edit
int buffer[10];
Test:

Writing at index 0 ‚úÖ

Writing at index 9 ‚úÖ

Writing at index 10 ‚ùå (should fail or be protected)

‚úÖ What is validated:

Proper bounds checking

Array indexing, pointer arithmetic

Input range enforcement (min, max, overflow)

üõ† Tools used:

Unit tests with boundary values

Dynamic analysis (e.g., Valgrind for memory issues)

Runtime assertions

4Ô∏è‚É£ Driver Testing
üîç Description:
Tests low-level hardware drivers like GPIO, I2C, SPI, ADC, and PWM by inspecting code behavior directly and simulating hardware events via mocks.

üß™ Example:
Testing I2C temperature sensor driver:

Mock sensor to return 0x7FFF

Ensure function interprets this as +127.9¬∞C

Simulate NACK from device and verify retry logic

‚úÖ What is validated:

Register reads/writes, timing delays

Handling of hardware faults (e.g., NACK, busy)

Proper interrupt or DMA behavior if applicable

üõ† Tools used:

Code mocks for registers or buses

Hardware simulation in IDE or CI pipelines

Debugger (e.g., OpenOCD) to step through logic
